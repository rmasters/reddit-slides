Reddit-slides is a web application that pulls images from a subreddit and
rotates through them using jQuery. It requires PHP.

General usage
-------------
* Adding the ?r=reddit parameter allows you to select a subreddit. /r/pics is
  the default.

Things that are broken
----------------------
* While the crawler can root out self posts from the feed it doesn't quite
  handle non-image links yet.
* Support for externally hosted reddits is broken.

Things that would be useful
---------------------------
* A way to either crawl links from comments or the main image from a linked post
  (a la Facebook).

There are more 'todos' noted in data.php. If you have any ideas feel free to
message me via github or [reddit](http://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=rmas).
